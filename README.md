### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [shack.js](https://github.com/shack-js/shack.js) a fullstack framework that save you from coding http server and http requests, a bit look like `Next.JS getServerSideProps` but more clean and less buggy. You can find project templates for commonjs/modulejs/typescript, react/vue, micro-service/micro-frontend [here](https://github.com/fullstack-boilerplates)
