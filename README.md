### Hi there 👋
Looking for a job now, if you're interested reach me at postor@gmail.com

  🔭 I’m currently working on [shack.js](https://github.com/shack-js/shack.js) a fullstack framework(or say tool) that save you from coding http server and http requests, a bit look like `Next.JS getServerSideProps` but more clean and less buggy. You can find project templates for `commonjs`/`modulejs`/`typescript`, `react`/`vue`, `micro-service`/`micro-frontend`, `MUI`/`TypeORM`/`APM`/`Docker`/... [here](https://github.com/fullstack-boilerplates). [shack.js](https://github.com/shack-js/shack.js) is based on `express` and `webpack`, fully customizable (raise issue case it's not, and I'll fix it)
